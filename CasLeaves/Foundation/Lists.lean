# The list functor on presented sets

`L = List` on presented sets: `X ↦ List X`, presented by `SetHandle.list`. The realization of sets
is induced, so the action is the lift of `L` (`RealizedAction.induced`), and the registered cells
of `L` (unit, join, reversal) are realized on it by the core as preimages.
