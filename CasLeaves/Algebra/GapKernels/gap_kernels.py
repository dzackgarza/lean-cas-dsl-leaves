"""The backend program of the GAP kernels leaf (`CasLeaves/Algebra/GapKernels.lean`), owned by the
leaf: operations keyed by registered semantic operations, computed by GAP (through `libgap`),
answered as untrusted JSON that the leaf decodes into the operation's semantic result type or
rejects. It speaks the port protocol through the core's Python reference module `cas_port`.

* `lim.groups.kernel`: the kernel `K ↪ G` of a homomorphism of group tables `f : G → H`, computed
  by GAP's `Kernel` of `GroupHomomorphismByImages` between the right regular permutation
  representations; answered as the table of `K` and its inclusion.

`--hostile=MODE` reproduces backend mistakes the caller must reject: `capability` also announces an
operation that is not registered (an own subgroup notion), `forget-inclusion` answers a kernel
without its inclusion, `whole-group` answers the whole group as the kernel.

Run with a Python that has `passagemath-gap` (or Sage), from the repository root:
`.venv/bin/python CasLeaves/Algebra/GapKernels/gap_kernels.py`.
