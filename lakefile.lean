Computational leaves of `lean-cas-dsl`: realizations only. A leaf registers, through
`register_leaf`, how presentations of already-formal objects are computed; it contributes no
mathematics (that is `lean-categories`') and never sees the tests it is measured by (those are
`lean-cas-dsl`'s, which depends on this package, not the reverse). It is written against the leaf
contract alone. See `AGENTS.md`.
